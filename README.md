# Cat wrangler API



This is a reference implementation of the   [Landry Enterprise Specification](https://github.com/MiLandry/Landry-Enterprise-Specification)


It is the backing API to the [frontend](https://github.com/MiLandry/cat-wrangler-react)








# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.

## How do you implement the stubs
I think you add your ORM / middle ware to the service layer (eg EventService.js)
